             Choose Your Therapist LLP was born out of an idea during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when the need for accessible and trusted mental health care became more evident than ever. What began as a simple initiative through an Instagram page and late-night website experiments gradually took shape into a structured platform.
On 16th July 2021, Choose Your Therapist LLP was officially incorporated, making the vision a registered reality. Today, CYT operates under the legal frameworks of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises).
Rather than being “just a platform,” Choose Your Therapist is a continuing journey — connecting individuals with mental health professionals, fostering awareness, and creating safe spaces where therapy is approachable and trusted.
